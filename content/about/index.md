My name is Dirk Groot, born in [1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977), and I am a software engineer and architect. Programming
has been my greatest passion since my early teens.

When I was about 10 years old, my uncle gave me a Commodore 64. With it, he also gave me some C64 magazines. These magazines
contained some information about programming, which I found very interesting. Not long afterwards, programming was my biggest hobby.

Since I started working as a software engineer in 1999, I've worked on many different kinds of software: Embedded, windows forms,
frontend, backend, transaction oriented, batch oriented, etc. I've also used many programming languages, and I'm always eager to
learn more. Currently, my favourites are Kotlin, TypeScript and Clojure.

I'm also really passionate about software design, architecture and agile software development. I'm particularly fond of
test-driven development, [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it), and Kent Beck's
[four rules of simple design](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/classics/expemergentdesign).

### Private life

I'm married, and we have 3 children (all teenagers). When I'm not programming, I like to run, take hikes in the many forests in and
around Arnhem, watch movies and series, read a book, and occasionally play a video game.
