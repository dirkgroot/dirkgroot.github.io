[{"content":"My name is Dirk Groot, born in 1977, and I am a software engineer and architect. Programming has been my greatest passion since my early teens.\nWhen I was about 10 years old, my uncle gave me a Commodore 64. With it, he also gave me some C64 magazines. These magazines contained some information about programming, which I found very interesting. Not long afterwards, programming was my biggest hobby.\nSince I started working as a software engineer in 1997, I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on many different kinds of software: Embedded, windows forms, frontend, backend, transaction oriented, batch oriented, etc. I\u0026rsquo;ve also used many programming languages, and I\u0026rsquo;m always eager to learn more. Currently, my favourites are Kotlin, TypeScript and Clojure.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also really passionate about software design, architecture and agile software development. I\u0026rsquo;m particularly fond of test-driven development, YAGNI, and Kent Beck\u0026rsquo;s four rules of simple design.\nPrivate life I\u0026rsquo;m married, and we have 3 children (all teenagers). When I\u0026rsquo;m not programming, I like to run, take hikes in the many forests in and around Arnhem, watch movies and series, read a book, and occasionally play a video game.\n","permalink":"https://dirkgroot.github.io/about/","summary":"My name is Dirk Groot, born in 1977, and I am a software engineer and architect.
