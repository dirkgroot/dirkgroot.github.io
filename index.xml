Programming
has been my greatest passion since my early teens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was about 10 years old, my uncle gave me a Commodore 64. With it, he also gave me some C64 magazines. These magazines
contained some information about programming, which I found very interesting. Not long afterwards, programming was my biggest hobby.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I started working as a software engineer in 1997, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on many different kinds of software: Embedded, windows forms,
frontend, backend, transaction oriented, batch oriented, etc. I&amp;rsquo;ve also used many programming languages, and I&amp;rsquo;m always eager to
learn more. Currently, my favourites are Kotlin, TypeScript and Clojure.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
